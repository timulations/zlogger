# zlogger
Header-only, thread-safe, lightweight, stream-overloaded logger

## Getting Started
Simply grab the header file `zlogger.hpp` from the `include` folder and include into your project ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ

## Examples
To build the examples:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Logging to console
zlogger logs to console by default. 
```cpp
LOG_TRACE << "testing, testing!"; /* should not appear by default */
LOG_INFO << "Hello there!";
LOG_INFO << "My name is " << " Timothy," << " and my age is: " << 25;
LOG_ERROR << "Oops, I made a mistake!";
LOG_WARN << "My hair is not doing great today with a spikiness index of " << 0.78283 << " , goodness!";

zlogger::set_level(zlogger::level::error);
LOG_WARN << "My hair still isn't that great!"; /* should not appear */
LOG_ERROR << "Mistake number 2!";
LOG_DEBUG << "Hi"; /* should not appear */

zlogger::set_level(zlogger::level::trace); /* everything should appear now */
LOG_TRACE << "Test test #2!"; 
LOG_DEBUG << "Debuggin'";
LOG_INFO << "INfo-in'";
LOG_WARN << "Warn-in'";
LOG_ERROR << "Kaboom";
```

The output may look something like:
```
[INFO][07/06/22 18:47:55][PID: 43136] Hello there!
[INFO][07/06/22 18:47:55][PID: 43136] My name is  Timothy, and my age is: 25
[ERROR][07/06/22 18:47:55][PID: 43136] Oops, I made a mistake!
[WARN][07/06/22 18:47:55][PID: 43136] My hair is not doing great today with a spikiness index of 0.78283 , goodness!
[ERROR][07/06/22 18:47:55][PID: 43136] Mistake number 2!
[TRACE][07/06/22 18:47:55][PID: 43136] Test test #2!
[DEBUG][07/06/22 18:47:55][PID: 43136] Debuggin'
[INFO][07/06/22 18:47:55][PID: 43136] INfo-in'
[WARN][07/06/22 18:47:55][PID: 43136] Warn-in'
[ERROR][07/06/22 18:47:55][PID: 43136] Kaboom
```

To explicitly log to console (or switch back to logging to console):
```cpp
zlogger::set_output_stream(std::cout);
```

### Logging to file
Simply change output stream and then log away ðŸš€
```cpp
std::ofstream out_file_handle(LOGFILE_PATH);
if (out_file_handle.is_open()) {
    zlogger::set_output_stream(out_file_handle);
} else {
    throw std::runtime_error(std::string("Could not open ") + LOGFILE_PATH + " for writing");
}

LOG_TRACE << "testing, testing!"; /* should not appear by default */
LOG_INFO << "Hello there!";
```
